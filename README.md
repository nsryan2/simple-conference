Things that need to get done for coding:
all of the things, stupid idea

Information that should be compiled:
1) Specific contacts for each page
2) photos for pretty much everything
3) speakers and speaker bios
4) what the heck is needed for the career fair
5) all the tours (times, dates, starting locations)
6) about ans
7) respectful behavior
8) code of ethics
9) hotel maps!
10) pricing for attendance
11) is it ok that the Once you're here page goes straight to the map?
12) for registration, do we need some sort of record keeper or can we use a third party to the site? (google forms?) more formal?
