                    <h3>ANS Code of Ethics</h3>
                    <h3>Preamble</h3>
                    <p>Recognizing the profound importance of nuclear science and technology in affecting the quality of life throughout the world, members of the American Nuclear Society (ANS) are committed to the highest ethical and professional conduct.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Fundamental Principle</h3>
                    <p>ANS members as professionals are dedicated to improving the understanding of nuclear science and technology, appropriate applications, and potential consequences of their use.
To that end, ANS members uphold and advance the integrity and honor of their professions by using their knowledge and skill for the enhancement of human welfare and the environment; being honest and impartial; serving with fidelity the public, their employers, and their clients; and striving to continuously improve the competence and prestige of their various professions.</p>
             <p>ANS members shall subscribe to the following practices of professional conduct:</p>
                    <h3>Principles of Professional Conduct</h3>
                    <p>1.  We hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public and fellow workers, work to protect the environment, and strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development in the performance of our professional duties.</p>
<p>2.  We will formally advise our employers, clients, or any appropriate authority and, if warranted, consider further disclosure, if and when we perceive that pursuit of our professional duties might have adverse consequences for the present or future public and fellow worker health and safety or the environment.</p>
<p>3.  We act in accordance with all applicable laws and these Practices, lend support to others who strive to do likewise, and report violations to appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>4.  We perform only those services that we are qualified by training or experience to perform, and provide full disclosure of our qualifications.</p>
<p>5.  We present all data and claims, with their bases, truthfully, and are honest and truthful in all aspects of our professional activities. We issue public statements and make presentations on professional matters in an objective and truthful manner.</p>
<p>6.  We continue our professional development and maintain an ethical commitment throughout our careers, encourage similar actions by our colleagues, and provide opportunities for the professional and ethical training of those persons under our supervision.</p>
<p>7.  We act in a professional and ethical manner towards each employer or client and act as faithful agents or trustees, disclosing nothing of a proprietary nature concerning the business affairs or technical processes of any present or former client or employer without specific consent, unless necessary to abide by other provisions of this Code or applicable laws.</p>
<p>8.  We disclose to affected parties, known or potential conflicts of interest or other circumstances, which might influence, or appear to influence, our judgment or impair the fairness or quality of our performance.</p>
<p>9.  We treat all persons fairly.</p>
<p>10. We build our professional reputation on the merit of our services, do not compete unfairly with others, and avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment.</p>
<p>11. We reject bribery and coercion in all their forms.</p>
<p>12. We accept responsibility for our actions; are open to and acknowledge criticism of our work; offer honest criticism of the work of others; properly credit the contributions of others; and do not accept credit for work not our own.</p>
                    <p>Approved by ANS Special Committee on Ethics November 17, 2002.</p>
                    <p>Approved by ANS Board of Directors June 5, 2003.</p>
